# Semblage Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Semblage, an open source 3D CAD application that seeks to blend the mouse-driven and programmatic CAD worlds. If you are brand new to Semblage, it is recommended that you read the introduction page to get an overview of how to use this documentation.

***PLEASE NOTE*** Semblage is in pre-alpha, and is not overly useable yet. There will be a release once it has reached alpha quality with the minimum-viable feature set. This documentation is only partly complete, and will change significantly before the first release.
