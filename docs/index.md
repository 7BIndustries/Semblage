# Semblage Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Semblage, a community-based, open source 2D/3D CAD application that seeks to blend the mouse-driven and programmatic CAD worlds. If you are brand new to Semblage, it is recommended that you read the [introduction page](introduction.md) to get an overview of what Semblage is before moving on to the [Getting Started page](getting_started.md).

If you get stuck at any point while going through this documentation, you can ask questions on any of the [communication channels](community.md#communication-channels).

***PLEASE NOTE*** Semblage is in pre-alpha, and is not overly useable or stable yet. There will be a release once it has reached alpha quality with the minimum-viable feature set. This documentation is only partly complete, and will change significantly before the first release.
