# Installation

At the time of this writing there is no release, so there are no release packages to download. The only way of running Semblage at this time is to run a development setup. A release will be made soon though.

***NOTE*** Only 64-bit AMD and Intel systems are supported at this time. ARM, as well as AMD and Intel 32-bit support is not available.

There is no installer file for Semblage, it is distributed as a zip file that can be extracted and used as-is. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/releases), click on the latest release, and download the zip file for your operating system. Once the download is complete, extract the archive and run the `Semblage` binary in the root directory. Semblage should launch.

Once Semblage is up an running, you can proceed to the [Usage](usage.md) documentation.
