# Semblage

***Please Note*** Semblage is in pre-alpha, and is not overly useable yet. There will be a release once it has reached alpha quality with the minimum-viable feature set.

## Introduction

Semblage is an open source CAD GUI backed by a programmatic CAD API named CadQuery.

There are two advantages of programmatic CAD (a.k.a code-CAD) that Semblage seeks to capitalize on, and thus the user interface is designed to provide abstracted access to the code-CAD level.

1. Easier to capture design intent more effectively through code-CAD.
2. Enables very flexible, highly parametric designs.

Current development effort is directed towards implementing minimum-viable interfaces for all 3D and 2D (sketching) operations. Once this basic work is completed, the roadmap will guide the rest of the development. The intent will always be for the interface to be mouse driven, with as many of the advantages of programmatic CAD as possible being kept.
