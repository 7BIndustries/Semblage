# Semblage

[![tests](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

***Please Note*** Semblage is in alpha, and so bugs and missing functionality should be expected.

## Introduction

Semblage is an open source CAD GUI backed by a programmatic CAD API named CadQuery.

There are two main advantages of programmatic CAD (a.k.a code-CAD) that Semblage seeks to capitalize on in a mouse and GUI driven way.

1. Easier to capture design intent more effectively through code-CAD.
2. Enables very flexible, highly parametric designs.

Current development effort is directed towards implementing minimum-viable interfaces for all 3D and 2D (sketching) operations. Once this basic work is completed, the roadmap will guide the rest of the development. The intent will always be for the interface to be mouse driven, with as many of the advantages of programmatic CAD as possible being kept.

All of this is and much more is covered in the [documentation](https://semblage.7bindustries.com/en/latest/).
