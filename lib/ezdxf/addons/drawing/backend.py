        The strategy to draw multiple paths at once was chosen, because a HATCH
        entity can contain multiple unconnected areas and the holes are not easy
        to assign to an external path.

        The idea is to put all filled areas into `paths` (counter-clockwise
        winding) and all holes into `holes` (clockwise winding) and look what
        the backend does with this information.

        The HATCH fill strategies ("ignore", "outermost", "ignore") are resolved

        strategy and for the "outermost" strategy, holes do not contain nested
        holes.

        holes by the :meth:`draw_filled_polygon` method. Backends can override
        this method if filled polygon with hole support is available.
