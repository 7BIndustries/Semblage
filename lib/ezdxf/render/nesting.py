This module provides "nested Polygon" detection for multiple paths.

Terminology
-----------

exterior
    creates a filled area, has counter-clockwise (ccw) winding in matplotlib
    exterior := Path

hole
    creates an unfilled area, has clockwise winding (cw) in matplotlib,
    hole := Polygon

polygon
    list of nested paths:
    polygon without a hole: [path]
    polygon with 1 hole: [path, [path]]
    polygon with 2 separated holes: [path, [path], [path]]
    polygon with 2 nested holes: [path, [path, [path]]]

    polygon := [exterior, hole*]

The result is a list of polygons:

1 polygon returns: [[ext-path]]
2 separated polygons returns: [[ext-path], [ext-path, [hole-path]]]

A hole is just another polygon, for a correct visualisation in
matplotlib the winding of the nested paths have to follow the alternating
order ccw-cw-ccw-cw... :

[Exterior-ccw,
    [Hole-Exterior-cw,
        [Sub-Hole-ccw],
        [Sub-Hole-ccw],
    ],
    [Hole-Exterior-cw],
    [Hole-Exterior-cw],
]

The implementation has to do some expensive tests, like check if a path is
inside of another path or if paths do overlap. A goal is to reduce this costs
by using proxy objects:

Bounding Box Proxy
------------------

Use the bounding box, this is very fast but not accurate, but could handle
most of the real world scenarios, in the assumption that most HATCHES are
created from non-overlapping boundary paths.
Overlap detection and resolving is not possible.

Bounding Box Construction:
- Fast: use bounding box from control vertices
- Accurate: use bounding box from flattened curve

Inside Check:
- Fast: center point of the bounding box
- Slow: use all corner points of the bounding box


Convex Hull Proxy
-----------------

Use the convex hull of the path, this is more accurate but also
much slower. Overlap detection and resolving is not possible.

Convex Hull construction:
- Fast: use convex hull from control vertices
- Accurate: use convex hull from flattened curve

Inside Check:
- Fast: center point of convex hull
- Slow: use all points of the convex hull


Flattened Curve
---------------

Use the flattened curve vertices, this is the most accurate solution and also
the slowest. Overlap detection and resolving is possible: exterior is the
union of two overlapping paths, hole is the intersection of this two paths,
the hole vertices have to be subtracted from the exterior vertices.

Sort by Area
------------

It is not possible for a path to contain another path with a larger area.
